## **Introduction**
In the realm of banking, gaining insights into potential defaulters for the Consumer Loans product is crucial for informed decision-making. This report aims to explore valuable insights derived from probability and hypothesis testing within a dataset that encompasses variables such as age, income, marital status, experience, city, profession, and risk flag (indicating loan default occurrences). By analyzing these factors, our objective is to predict who possible defaulters are for the consumer loans product.
